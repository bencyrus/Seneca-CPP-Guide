# A Lazy guy's guide for studying computer programming at Seneca

First of all!!!!
>Break it down before you even begin

Second!!
>Your advisor doesn’t know anything :/

Now! There are 3 types of people.
Some are like me and want to get this over with and take as many courses as they possibly can just to finish it faster. 
Guess what???
## THERE AIN’T NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF COURSES YOU TAKE!!!

You just must have the prerequisites
Now, you would think the official course map is right, it is the course map drawn by the creators of the program that thousands of students follow, right? **WRONG!!!**

![This is an image](https://students.senecacollege.ca/attachment?file=2NPtkFCLkvf%2BE1%2Blhv9TZQ%3D%3D)

## LET’S CLARIFY :)
First semester: It says you can take IPC144, APS145, CPR101, ULI101, and COM111. That is CORRECT.
But what they don’t tell you is that you can take any of the electives you want (ELS), because they don’t have prerequisites. Wanna take 8 courses instead of 5? Go for it! (Not recommended for the first semester though. Go with 6 maybe? Profs are a pain in the first semester).
Now they say the filled lines are prerequisites. **LIARS!** PMC is a 4th-semester course but has no pre-requisite! Take it in your second sem if you want. Maybe even first? Nobody cares :)

Everybody takes SYD in the 3rd sem, but. You can take that too in the second if you pass IPC!
So imagine you pass all 5 mandatory courses of the first semester. Now you can technically take all these in your second semester:
OOP244, Web222, SFT221, DBS211, SYD366, EAC594, PMC115 and any elective you want
Another lie they tell you is that DSA456 has OOP345 as a prerequisite. BULLSHIT!

My professor was surprised when she learned I hadn’t done OOP345 and got in but it is not a pre-requisite!
So in your 3rd semester, you can take:
OOP345, DSA456, WEB322, DBS311, and Professional Option (Some of them have OOP244 and other second-semester courses as requirements instead of oop345).

If you do this, congratulations!!!! You finish the Seneca CPP program in 3 semesters (Only if someone had told me I could do that!!! :)

Now if you are completely the opposite, then you can take as few as 3 courses to be a full-time student. The best tip for someone like you is to make sure you take the ones that are actually prerequisites as soon as you can take them.

First Semester (At least IPC, APS, and COM) - pass these 3 you can pick any course you want

Second Semester (At least OOP244, WEB222, and DBS211) - pass these 3 you can pick any course you want

Third Semester and later (TAKE WHATEVER YOU WISH!!!) although if you take OOP345 and/or WEB322, you have more option in professional options to pick from, no sweat! Thanks for the glorious **MST300** :)

The third type of student is someone between the two. 
If you want to go with the normal pace and finish in 4 semesters, do similar to the ones who want to take it slow.  

First Semester (At least IPC, APS, and COM) - pass these 3 you can pick any course you want

Second Semester (At least OOP244, WEB222, and DBS211) - pass these 3 you can pick any course you want

Third Semester and later (TAKE WHATEVER YOU WISH!!!) although if you take OOP345 and/or WEB322, you have more option in professional options to pick from, no sweat! Thanks for the glorious **MST300** :)

Now if you want to make the most out of the program, take your courses in this order.

First Semester:
**IPC144, APS145, COM111**, CPR101, ULI101  (Take an elective if you want and don’t feel overwhelmed)

Second Semester:
**OOP244, DBS211, WEB222**, SFT221, SYD366, EAC594 (the last one is really easy. SYD too (will explain, it has a trick) also take an elective or two here so the next 2 semesters are easier)

Third Semester:
From here you are pretty much free to do whatever you wish, but what I recommend is the following:
**OOP345, DBS311, WEB322**, (I would take DSA here personally so the last semester would be much easier and sure to graduate. Also in case you fail DSA :). If you haven't taken SYD, take it here or in the last semester, doesn’t matter. – This semester will be hard like this, that’s why you should take electives and some courses from the 4th semester in the first two– This way your last semester is easy enough to you can start preparing for work and apply for jobs!!!

In case you fail any of the IPC144, OOP244, or OOP345, don’t worry, your graduation will not be delayed if you are smart about it :). Will telly you what to do now. Just don’t ever postpone them unless it is 345!

- If you fail IPC:
You can not take OOP244, Web211, or SFT. What you can do is:
IPC144 again :), DBS211, EAC594, PMC115, - Your 3 electives so you are done with them -
This semester will be really easy though, so take as many electives as you can and prepare for the next semester courses (I will get to preparations as well)

- If you fail OOP244:
You can not take OOP345, DSA456, and most of the professional options (maybe all?)
What you can take though if you have passed others are: 
DBS311, WEB322, SYD366, (electives if you have any left or PMC or EAC if you didn’t take them before)
But I have to tell you, if you fail 244, last semester will be a little bit tough! But you can go with my guide which I will add and be sure to pass them all :)
The fourth semester will be: OOP345, DSA456, Professional Option, electives, PMC or anything else you haven’t taken yet. If you are smart about it, you take all those prior so you only have these 3 to do.

- And if you fail OOP345!!!
Doesn't Matter LOL! You can still find some professional options that you can take and take last semester have OOP345, DSA456, and whatever else you have left OOP345 isn’t a pre-requisite for them!!!

## YES!!!

#### Here is a list of real pre-requisites for courses:
**IPC144, APS145, CPR101, ULI101, COM111 or 101**, Most of the electives **(NO PRE-REQUISITE! Take them anytime)**
**PMC115:** This is weird but it has no prerequisites either!!!
**OOP244:** IPC144 **AND** APS145
**WEB222:** IPC144
**DBS211:** IPC144 **OR** ULI101  -  Pay attention to the **OR** keyword -
**SFT221:** IPC144
**EAC594:** COM101 **OR** COM111
**SYD366:** IPC144 **AND** COM101 or 111
**OOP345:** OOP244
**WEB322:** WEB222
**DBS311:** DBS211
**DSA456:** OOP244

*** Note: PMC may not let you take it at first, try all the time. It prioritizes last semester students and CPA students, but you can find a spot sometime! ***

There are some tips I have to make everything easier.

When I say Udemy, I mean it. It is a perfect supplement! It is not extra work, it saves you time!
 * Quick Note: Doesn’t matter if you have been a programmer for a few years. Unless you are pretty fluent in C and C++, you are gonna feel pressure in this course. I programmed for 3 years in python and other languages but found the course difficult. Maybe even more than people with no experience at all?! *

You can buy Udemy courses for 15-20$ when you first sign up. If you don’t see them for that price, wait for a few days. If you don’t purchase a course for a week, 100$ courses will be discounted to 15-20$ again. Or just make a new account! I have 3 :)

General Tips:
**Do NOT** miss any of your first assignments, labs, quizzes, or workshops!!! The last ones are so hard to do or get good grades at. Make sure you do the first 3-4 perfectly and ON_TIME!
Code along with the Udemy courses! Do it don’t say I know it :)

## IPC144:

What you must do is forget you even have a prof for this course. Buy the Udemy course and study ahead of the class. Don’t worry if you feel dumbfounded or feel like you don’t understand anything! That’s normal. When you learn it from Udemy first (which goes into more depth than your prof) then when the prof says, you totally get it! This way you spend 2 hours a week but I promise it saves you more than 10 hours a week when doing the workshops and final project!

Each week, check the title for the next week, go find that title and watch it on this Udemy course. This one is the best and closest to Seneca! Don’t go based on the Udemy order, go based on your course subject order, unless you wanna finish the Udemy course long before the semester ends, in which case, Good for you. You are gonna get an A :)!!!

Extra Tips: 

- Get the first workshops, you are gonna hate the last ones lol.
- Do Not let pointers distract you. Pointers and File reading are the most annoying part. Search online, pay a tutor, and do whatever you can because they are not difficult, just confusing. If you learn them, you will find OOP244 much easier than I found it :)
- Also, if you want good grades or want to be sure you pass, Do NOT take your class with Cameron Gray because of schedule or whatever. Just go to class another day. If you have Cameron as a Prof, you are going to be spending 10-15 more hours than other students PER WEEK!!
- If you want more resources, just watch Fardad Soleimanloo’s videos on YouTube for IPC but no need. Udemy is better

## OOP244:

**Exactly like IPC!!**
What you must do is forget you even have a prof for this course. Buy the Udemy course and study ahead of the class. Don’t worry if you feel dumbfounded or feel like you don’t understand anything! That’s normal. When you learn it from Udemy first (which goes into more depth than your prof) then when the prof says, you totally get it!

You are gonna get an A :)!!!


OOP becomes so fun when you get to actually OOP with member functions and stuff. I would watch the whole Udemy course and watch Fardad’s videos before the term starts. This way you will save time too. This course takes time. It will surprise you.


Extra Tips: 

- Get the first workshops.
- If you find pointers confusing or words like Constructor and Destructor weird, then you haven’t watched Udemy videos, you DUMMY!! - That’s what happened to me - Watch them and come back.
- Fardad is a good prof. A bit easier than Huang. But both are good. As a general rule, the worst a prof is, the easier he is on the exams and assignments :). So, self-study anyways!

My Strategy would be:
1. Watch Udemy
2. Watch Fardad’s Lecture on that topic
3. Read the course notes
